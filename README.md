# serial-plotter package

Package for ATOM Text Editor to show Data from a Serial Port as a Panel in ATOM.

I did this to show data from an Arduino, sent by this library: https://github.com/devinaconley/arduino-plotter

- Reads continuous multi-variable plots against time
- No Support for XY-Graphs yet.

Dependencies:

- Python3 with Serial library installed
- Atom "file-icons" package

this thing is working but still work-in-progress!

in Settings.json you can change your standard window height and your resolution (number of data points in width).
